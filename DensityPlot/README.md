# DensityPlot

As KDE (kernel density estimation) plots do not work well with binary data, we opted for many different plots instead. These are all generated by `densityGen.py`.
They further are the plots for the winning model found at the end of our protocols appendix and include a precision-recall curve, ROC-AUC curve and different plots to describe how the predictions for the classes are distributed regarding their amount.
