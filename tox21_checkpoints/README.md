# Tox21 checkpoints

- the `standard_set` directory holds all checkpoints for models trained on the standard Tox21 set
- the `full_set` directory holds all checkpoints for models trained on our large Tox21 set
- the `optimization` directory holds optimization results for all optimized models

To get full information on a model, the `args.json` file in the models folder is the first place to go. 
Performance is best seen in the `quiet.log` file or directly in our `auc_plot.png` plot.
